Hey, there! I am a pre-doctoral researcher in the Media and Data Science Research (MDSR) lab at Adobe. My current research interests include data efficiency and human-cognition inspired architectures/algorithms in NLP (motivated largely by how we, humans, learn so much from so little!). Apart from these, I'm also interested in interpretability of LMs and adaptation of LMs post-pretraining (e.g., instruction tuning).

Prior to joining Adobe, I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) (IIT Bombay) in 2023, with a Bachelors degree (with Honors) in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/#/). I feel incredibly privileged to have been advised by [Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) and [Prof. Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/) for my Undergraduate Thesis on [Data-Efficient Pretraining of Language models](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.445/) using Submodular Functions, which I presented at [EMNLP 2023](https://2023.emnlp.org/). 

My long-term research goal is to develop provably beneficial intelligent computational agents that can excel at both formal linguistic competence (the knowledge of rules and statistical regularities of language) and functional linguistic competence (the ability to use language in real-world situations).

If you share an interest in these topics and would like to exchange research ideas, please do not hesitate to contact me via [e-mail](mailto:rharisrikowndinya333@gmail.com).
